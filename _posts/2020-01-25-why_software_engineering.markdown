I believe the quote above really captures how I was pointed towards software engineering. After studying physics for three semesters I needed to fill in an elective to graduate. So I went to the registrar to go over the lists of electives; not many stuck out to me until we came across programming 1 with C++. I had always enjoyed working with computers but had never tried programming before this. I never could of guessed how much I would enjoy it.

After a few weeks this class became the highlight of my day and I developed a deep interest in learning the C++ language.  So when I finished the first class I decieded to take more programming classes even after graduation. In these classes I created programs ragningfrom Hello World to bank accounts, simple dating algorithms, and a basic object oriented video game. The thought process I developed from these projects really changed how I looked at learning and solving problems. 

I still plan on studying physics, but do not see a reason I cannot get a job I enjoy while I continue to go to school for the next 4 years. Even once I finish school I do not see myself leaving Software Engineering behind. I plan on incorporating everything I learn here into any and all jobs I get from here on out. I think this skill has left a deep impact on my life and I am excited to further my understanding as I go through this course.
