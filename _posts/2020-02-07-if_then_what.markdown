Logic and Conditionals are powerful blocks of code. The control flow you get when using them will bleed into your everyday life and in my opinion that is the best way to master this subject. When I started learning logic and conditionals I saw alot of day to day real-world choices that followed their pattern. The more examples I discovered in the easier it became to make these blocks in code and vice versea; the more of them I wrote in code the easier it was to see them in action in my own thought process. After doing this for sometime I found that much of my decision making process had mirrored that of Logic and Conditional Blocks, and really cleaned up its organization. So if you are finding this subject hard don't give up just keep looking for examples and Practice often.
